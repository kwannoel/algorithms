* Algorithm properties:
| Sorting Algorithm | Best-case | Worst-case | Average-case | Space Complexity | Stable?                     |
|-------------------+-----------+------------+--------------+------------------+-----------------------------|
| Merge             | nlogn     | nlogn      | nlogn        |                n | Yes                         |
| Insertion         | n         | n^2        | n^2          |                1 | Yes                         |
| Bubble            | n         | n^2        | n^2          |                1 | Yes                         |
| Quicksort         | nlogn     | n^2        | nlogn        |                n | No (can optimize to stable) |
| Selection         | n^2       | n^2        | n^2          |                1 | No (can optimize to stable) |

* Properties:
- Stable sort

  Relative position does not change for equal elements

  When there's swapping in place there's no issue (usually)

- In place sort


  No additional space needed to sort

* Runtime:
Best case:
Average case: Randomly sample
Worst case: Worst case is usually almost correct but not there
